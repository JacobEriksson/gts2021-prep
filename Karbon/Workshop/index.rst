---------------
Getting Started
---------------

This workshop is helping you in trying to understand where Nutanix can help organisation in their transistion towards Cloud Native Application based on Kubernetes.

Pre-requirements
++++++++++++++++

As this workshop is using Kubernetes and a lot of command line commands, some knowledge on Kubernetes is a pre, not a must.

Agenda
++++++

- Prepare your environment for the workshop by deploying and configuring the WinTools VM
- Deploying a blueprint so we have the needed Database infrastructure and registered in era
- Deploy Karbon as the kubernetes platform
- Install and configure needed components in kubernetes

  - Load Balancer
  - Ingress controller
  - Logging
  - Monitoring

- Deploy the organisation's application
- Change the ingress controller
- Deploy Objects
- Install and configure a backup solution
- Expand your Karbon cluster
- Upgrade a Kubernetes infrastructure


Introductions
+++++++++++++

- Name
- Familiarity with Nutanix

Initial Setup
+++++++++++++

- Take note of the *Passwords* being used.
- Log into your virtual desktops (connection info below)

Environment Details
+++++++++++++++++++

Nutanix Workshops are intended to be run in the Nutanix Hosted POC environment. Your cluster will be provisioned with all necessary images, networks, and VMs required to complete the exercises.

Networking
..........

Hosted POC clusters follow a standard naming convention:

- **Cluster Name** - POC\ *XYZ*
- **Subnet** - 10.**21**.\ *XYZ*\ .0
- **Cluster IP** - 10.**21**.\ *XYZ*\ .37

If provisioned from the marketing pool:

- **Cluster Name** - MKT\ *XYZ*
- **Subnet** - 10.**20**.\ *XYZ*\ .0
- **Cluster IP** - 10.**20**.\ *XYZ*\ .37

For example:

- **Cluster Name** - POC055
- **Subnet** - 10.21.55.0
- **Cluster IP** - 10.21.55.37

Throughout the Workshop there are multiple instances where you will need to substitute *XYZ* with the correct octet for your subnet, for example:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 75
   :header-rows: 1
   * - IP Address
     - Description
   * - 10.21.\ *XYZ*\ .37
     - Nutanix Cluster Virtual IP
   * - 10.21.\ *XYZ*\ .39
     - **PC** VM IP, Prism Central
   * - 10.21.\ *XYZ*\ .40
     - **DC** VM IP, NTNXLAB.local Domain Controller

Each cluster is configured with 2 VLANs which can be used for VMs:

.. list-table::
  :widths: 25 25 10 40
  :header-rows: 1
  * - Network Name
    - Address
    - VLAN
    - DHCP Scope
  * - Primary
    - 10.21.\ *XYZ*\ .1/25
    - 0
    - 10.21.\ *XYZ*\ .50-10.21.\ *XYZ*\ .124
  * - Secondary
    - 10.21.\ *XYZ*\ .129/25
    - *XYZ1*
    - 10.21.\ *XYZ*\ .132-10.21.\ *XYZ*\ .253

Credentials
...........

.. note::

  The *<Cluster Password>* is unique to each cluster and will be provided by the leader of the Workshop.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 35 40
   :header-rows: 1
   * - Credential
     - Username
     - Password
